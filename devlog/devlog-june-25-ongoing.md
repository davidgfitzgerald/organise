In a stage of planning and ideation for the app development. 

I've been thinking about the app's core features and how to implement them.

Using cursor I have given the following prompt:

> Ok, help me write a development plan for this application. Help me ideate and brainstorm, so we will have more of a back and forth dialogue for while instead of writing to many files.
> 
> Give me a little breakdown of what the app does so far and help me brainstorm of a list of features that we could implement into the application. I want to gather some requirements of what the app currently does and the app will do upon completion of new features.
